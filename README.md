#### Response:
This article is about the Contract for the Web, which was written by Tim Berners-Lee as a global call for action to protect the World Wide Web that he created and make it safe and accessible for everyone. I thought it was interesting that the inventor of the Web himself acknowledged that it is so powerful now that it could be exploited in harmful ways and even wrote a 76-clause contract to address the issue. He calls for governments and companies to make the Internet available and affordable at all times, while also asking them to uphold people’s online privacy and data rights.

#### Eric's response:
I enjoyed reading this article and agree with the quote:
>The power of the web to transform people’s lives, enrich society and reduce inequality is one of the defining opportunities of our time. But if we don’t act now — and act together — to prevent the web being misused by those who want to exploit, divide and undermine, we are at risk of squandering that potential
It is extremely important that people's identity and their information is protected on the internet, and it is nice to see that Tim Berners-Lee is making it his obligation to protect that information.

I think this article is important because companies and governments alike have used to web to violate privacy. There has also been a lot of internet restriction, censorship, and attempts to use the fact that the internet is now a vital part of most people's life to make more money. Because of these things, it is important to attempt to protect everyday users of the internet. -Eliana
