#### Response:
This article is about the Contract for the Web, which was written by Tim Berners-Lee as a global call for action to protect the World Wide Web that he created and make it safe and accessible for everyone. I thought it was interesting that the inventor of the Web himself acknowledged that it is so powerful now that it could be exploited in harmful ways and even wrote a 76-clause contract to address the issue. He calls for governments and companies to make the Internet available and affordable at all times, while also asking them to uphold peopleâ€™s online privacy and data rights.

I think this is important because companies and governments alike have used to web to violate privacy. There has also been a lot of internet restriction, censorship, and attempts to use the fact that the internet is now a vital part of most people's life to make more money. Because of these things, it is important to attempt to protect everyday users of the internet. -Eliana
